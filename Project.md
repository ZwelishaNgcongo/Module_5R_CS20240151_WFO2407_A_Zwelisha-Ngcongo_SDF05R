Project object:-creating buttons that are interactive, that are inclusive of various animations and transitions in order to giver the user a pleasant experience when accessing the site.
Project design choices:- Within my project I have opted for using animation more often then transition. Transition performs a task within a given duration, whilst my annimation can perform as a loop. Colour choices are relative basic I have opted for colors that people can resonate with(color choice in paramount when interacting with the market at large).
Challenges:Having to align my steps in order in order to achieve the desired outcome(eg :active having to preceed :hover and vice versa).
Proud moments: at first glance I had a semi pessimitic approach towards CSS(under the impression I lack creativity) having to attempt this project has been an eye opener for me. Nothing is beyond reach as long as one has a willing heart. Making my buttons spin, futhermore making them flip and addition having to add color  variation was rather fullfilling to me.
